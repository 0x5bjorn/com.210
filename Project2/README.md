# Second project
An command-line application that stores your products information in your storage. Main idea is to make menus (choose meal, recipe, chef, date of cooking etc.). It also can show you OnSale information of specific product in several markets. Another option is to record your purchase of product.

Libraries: Python

Compline and run:
```
python Project2.py
```

Parsing problems with parsing markets' websites:
1) Did not manage to insert parsed data to database. There are lots of invalid results come from parsing (for example, letter and number are set in chaos order). 
2) There is also problem with languages. It store in russian language, but the app shows some sings, symbols etc.
